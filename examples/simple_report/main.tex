% You can also use input, but there is slightly different behavior when it
% comes to .aux files and automatic linkage - input does a recursive search for
% input calls, and include does not. You can check out my Makefile for a linux
% friend automation of creating a build dir for latex (this includes the
% subdirectories and file transformations


\section{References}%
\label{sec:References}
Only the refs we cite will appear. Refer to your style to ensure you are using
the correct conventions (e.g., JMRL uses \verb|\cite| for in-line citations,
\verb|\citep| gives end-of-line parenthetical citations. It is highly suggested
to use bibtex and a \verb|.bib| file. The process tacks an external compilation
loop specifically for references (possibly also dealing with the \verb|ref|
citations aswell), generated a set of build files, which help speed up
compilation times.
