% I like to have all my sections in separate files, to make them easier to
% manage. Also helps me from getting overwhelmed. I have the section headers in
% the main.tex file, then subsections in the section files. This also makes it
% really easy to remove or add sections as need (e.g., abstracts or sets of
% beamer slides).

You can reference any label with \verb|\ref| for the static section number, or
you can use the Cleveref package to automatically bring along the label:
\verb|\cref| gives you lowercase, and \verb|\Cref| gives you capitalized. If
you have \verb|hyperref| imported, it should also give you an automatic
hyper-link to the pdf location.
