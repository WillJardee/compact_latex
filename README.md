# compact_latex
Collection of sty, cls, tex, and bib examples.

## Adding to MikTex
Most of these styles should be usable out of the box. The TEXMF root directory
must be registered. If you are using MikTex, as I do, you need to [register it
through the console](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/1137/where-do-i-place-my-own-sty-or-cls-files-to-make-them-available-to-all-my-te).
You only want to register the `mytexmf` folder.
